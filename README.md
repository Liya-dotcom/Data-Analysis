# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Description
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to uncover patterns in case counts, death rates, and vaccination progress across different countries. 
The analysis provides insights into how the pandemic affected nations differently based on factors like healthcare infrastructure, population demographics, and government responses.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Identify countries most impacted by COVID-19 in terms of total cases and deaths
2. Analyze vaccination rollout effectiveness across different regions
3. Examine anomalies and potential data reporting issues
4. Compare case rates relative to population size
5. Highlight successful pandemic response strategies

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python** (Primary programming language)
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation and analysis)
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Interactive analysis environment)
- **OWID COVID-19 Dataset** (Our World in Data)

## 🚀 How to Run/View the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Liya-dotcom/covid-19-analysis.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open and run `covid_analysis.ipynb` to view the analysis

## 🔍 Key Insights
1. **Top Impacted Countries**: United States, India, and Brazil had the highest total cases, reflecting both large populations and testing capabilities.

2. **Per Capita Analysis**: Small nations like San Marino showed disproportionately high case rates, likely due to population density or aggressive testing.

3. **Healthcare Success Stories**: UAE and Qatar maintained exceptionally low death rates, demonstrating effective healthcare responses.

4. **Vaccination Leaders**: High-income countries like UAE, Portugal, and Chile achieved >80% vaccination rates early in rollout campaigns.

5. **Data Reporting Anomalies**:
   - Sub-Saharan Africa's low reported cases may reflect under-testing
   - Russia/Eastern Europe showed higher death rates, possibly indicating healthcare strain

## 🤔 Reflections
This analysis highlights how pandemic outcomes were shaped by more than just biology - factors like governance, healthcare infrastructure, and data transparency played crucial roles. 
The disparities in vaccination access between high and low-income countries underscore the need for global cooperation in health crises. Future work could incorporate socioeconomic indicators to better understand response effectiveness.
